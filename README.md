# Smart Bus Ticketing with Face & QR Code

A modern, AI-powered ticketing system for public buses that uses face recognition and QR codes to streamline ticket verification, reduce fraud, and improve passenger experience.

---

## üöç Overview

This project enables seamless bus ticketing by combining face recognition and QR code scanning:

- **Boarding:** When a passenger enters the bus, a camera captures their face.
- **QR Scan:** The passenger scans a QR code inside the bus using the mobile app within 5 minutes.
- **Selfie Verification:** The app prompts the user to take a selfie, which is matched with the bus camera image.
- **Ticket/Pass:** If a ticket is purchased or a monthly pass is verified (using face and phone number), the journey continues.
- **Conductor Alert:** If verification fails, the conductor is alerted with the passenger‚Äôs photo and their location in the bus.

This system helps reduce missed ticket checks, speeds up boarding, and prevents fraud ‚Äî all using AI and minimal hardware.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (for CCTV simulation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-fare.git
   cd auto-fare
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4. **(Optional) Run CCTV Simulation:**
